Realtime 3D experiment written on the Microsoft XNA (Xbox, Windows, Windows Phone) Gaming Framework in C#.  This is some of my earliest work in the C# language, so much refactoring could occur.

Starting point is tutorial from Riemer Grootjans here: http://www.riemers.net/eng/Tutorials/XNA/Csharp/series4.php  Each additional commit shows my changes to achieve water effects.  THANK YOU to Riemer!
